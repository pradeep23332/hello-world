             <p> Currently we provide assignment guidance to anyone who is in need.<p/> <br/>However, this is not assignment outsourcing or assignment writing service but the students will be guided to complete their assignments by themselves. 
             <br/><br/>Students have opportunities to book an appointment with one of our tutors and get the support in understanding the assignment.<br/> <br/>Once the assignment has been done by the student feedback will be provided to revise or improve. In this way, students can complete their assignment by themselves. </p>
